Subject: Issue with Recent Order #A12345

Dear Customer Support,

I recently received my order #A12345 placed on December 10, 2025. Unfortunately, one of the items, the "Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones," arrived with a broken ear cup. The order also included a USB-C charging cable which is missing.

Please advise on how I can return the damaged item and receive a replacement. I would also like to know if the missing cable can be sent separately or included in the replacement.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Aisha Khan
