LLaMA is a large language model developed by Meta and is based on the transformer architecture.
Transformers use self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to process entire sequences
in parallel. This enables better understanding of long-range dependencies in text.

LLaMA models are pretrained on massive text corpora and can perform tasks such as question
answering, summarization, and text generation. However, these models may hallucinate when
asked questions outside their training data or when precise factual answers are required.
