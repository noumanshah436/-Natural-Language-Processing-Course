Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born December 25, 1876, in Karachi, British India; died September 11,
1948, in Karachi, Pakistan) was a lawyer, politician, and statesman who became the founder
and first Governor-General of Pakistan. He is widely known in Pakistan as Quaid-i-Azam,
meaning “Great Leader,” and is regarded as the father of the nation.

Jinnah was the eldest of seven children born to Jinnahbhai Poonja, a prosperous merchant,
and Mithibai. His family belonged to the Khoja community, which had converted to Islam
centuries earlier. There has been historical debate regarding Jinnah’s exact date of birth,
with some school records suggesting October 20, 1875, although Jinnah himself consistently
maintained that he was born on December 25, 1876.

Jinnah received his early education in Karachi at the Sind Madrasat al-Islam and later at
the Christian Missionary Society High School. At the age of sixteen, he passed the
matriculation examination of the University of Bombay. In 1892, he traveled to England to
study law and joined Lincoln’s Inn in London. In 1895, at just nineteen years of age, he was
called to the bar, becoming one of the youngest Indian barristers of his time.

During his years in London, Jinnah was deeply influenced by British parliamentary traditions
and liberal political thinkers such as William E. Gladstone. He frequently visited the
House of Commons and developed a strong belief in constitutionalism, rule of law, and
democratic governance. Despite personal tragedies, including the deaths of his mother and
first wife during this period, he completed his legal studies and returned to India in 1896.

Upon returning, Jinnah established his legal practice in Bombay, where he gradually gained
a reputation as one of the finest lawyers in India. His interest in politics grew alongside
his legal career, and in 1906 he attended his first session of the Indian National Congress.
In 1910, he was elected to the Imperial Legislative Council, marking the beginning of his
formal political career.

Initially, Jinnah was a strong advocate of Hindu-Muslim unity and worked tirelessly to bring
together the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League. His efforts earned
him the title “the best ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity,” a phrase attributed to Gopal
Krishna Gokhale. The most significant outcome of this cooperation was the Lucknow Pact of
1916, which established a framework for constitutional reforms and recognized separate
electorates for Muslims.

However, the political landscape changed with the rise of Mahatma Gandhi and the adoption
of mass-based movements such as noncooperation. Jinnah opposed these methods, believing in
constitutional and legal approaches to political reform. Disillusioned by growing communal
politics, he temporarily withdrew from active politics in the 1920s and spent several years
in England.

By the late 1930s, Jinnah had become convinced that Muslims in India required a separate
homeland to safeguard their political, economic, and cultural rights. Under his leadership,
the Muslim League was reorganized into a powerful political force. In March 1940, the League
adopted the Lahore Resolution, which called for the creation of independent states for
Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. This demand eventually led to the establishment of
Pakistan in 1947.

After independence, Jinnah became Pakistan’s first Governor-General. He faced immense
challenges, including refugee resettlement, administrative organization, and economic
stability. Despite declining health, he worked tirelessly to lay the foundations of the new
state, emphasizing unity, discipline, and faith.

Muhammad Ali Jinnah passed away on September 11, 1948. His legacy remains central to
Pakistan’s national identity, and his vision of a democratic state based on justice and the
rule of law continues to influence political thought in the country.
