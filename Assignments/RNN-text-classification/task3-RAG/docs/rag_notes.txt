Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with text generation.
Instead of relying only on a language model’s internal knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant
documents and injects them into the prompt.

This approach significantly reduces hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. RAG is
commonly used in chatbots, enterprise search systems, and document-based question answering
applications. Vector embeddings and similarity search are key components of RAG systems.
