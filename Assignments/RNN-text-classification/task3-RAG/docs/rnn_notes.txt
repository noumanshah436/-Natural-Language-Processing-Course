Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed for sequential data.
Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs maintain a hidden state that captures information from
previous time steps. This makes them suitable for tasks such as sentiment analysis, language
modeling, and speech recognition.

However, traditional RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, making it difficult to
learn long-term dependencies. To address this issue, architectures like LSTM and GRU were
introduced. These models use gating mechanisms to control the flow of information.

RNNs are computationally cheaper than large transformer models but usually provide lower
accuracy on complex language tasks.
