Solar energy is a renewable source of power that comes from the sun. It is captured using
solar panels, which are made up of photovoltaic (PV) cells. These cells convert sunlight
directly into electricity through a process known as the photovoltaic effect. When sunlight
hits the PV cells, it excites electrons and generates an electric current.

One of the main advantages of solar energy is that it produces electricity without releasing
greenhouse gases during operation. This makes it environmentally friendly and helps reduce
air pollution and dependence on fossil fuels. Solar energy systems also have low operating
costs after installation because sunlight is free and maintenance requirements are minimal.

Solar power systems can be installed at different scales. Small residential systems are
commonly placed on rooftops to provide electricity for homes, while large-scale solar farms
generate power for cities and industrial use. Solar panels can be connected to the electrical
grid or combined with batteries in off-grid systems.

However, solar energy has limitations. It depends heavily on sunlight availability and is
less effective during cloudy weather or at night. Seasonal changes can also affect energy
production. To address these challenges, energy storage systems such as batteries are often
used to store excess electricity generated during sunny periods.

Despite its limitations, solar energy continues to grow due to technological improvements.
Advances in panel efficiency, battery storage, and smart grid integration are making solar
power more reliable and accessible. As a result, solar energy plays an increasingly important
role in the global transition toward sustainable energy sources.
