World War II was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945, involving most of the world’s nations. It was the deadliest conflict in human history, resulting in an estimated 70–85 million casualties, including military personnel and civilians.

The war began on September 1, 1939, when Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. This invasion prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany. Over the next few years, the war expanded as Axis powers, including Germany, Italy, and Japan, sought territorial expansion, while the Allies, including Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and China, fought to stop them.

Key events of World War II include:

- **Fall of France (1940):** Germany quickly defeated France using blitzkrieg tactics, leading to the occupation of northern France.  
- **Battle of Britain (1940):** The Royal Air Force defended the United Kingdom against extensive German air raids, preventing a planned invasion.  
- **Operation Barbarossa (1941):** Germany invaded the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, which became one of the largest and bloodiest theaters of war.  
- **Pearl Harbor (1941):** Japan attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor on December 7, prompting the United States to enter the war.  
- **D-Day (1944):** On June 6, Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, marking the beginning of the liberation of Western Europe.  
- **Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945):** The United States dropped atomic bombs on these Japanese cities, leading to Japan’s surrender on August 15, 1945, effectively ending the war.

World War II had far-reaching consequences. It resulted in the redrawing of national borders, the establishment of the United Nations, and the beginning of the Cold War. The Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany, led to the systematic genocide of six million Jews, along with millions of other persecuted groups. Technological and scientific advances, including radar, jet engines, and nuclear weapons, also accelerated during the conflict.

The war also profoundly impacted civilian life. Cities were heavily bombed, economies were disrupted, and millions of people were displaced. Post-war reconstruction shaped the political, social, and economic landscapes of Europe, Asia, and other regions for decades to come.
