Question 3: What device is used to capture solar energy and convert it into electricity?
Answer 3: The device used to capture solar energy and convert it into electricity is called a Solar Panel. Solar panels are made up of photovoltaic (PV) cells, which are made from semiconducting materials that convert sunlight into electrical energy.

When sunlight hits the PV cells, it excites the electrons in the material, causing them to flow through the material and create an electric current. This current is then collected and sent through a circuit, where it can power devices such as lights, computers, and other electronic devices.

Solar panels are typically made up of multiple solar cells connected together in a series or parallel configuration to increase their overall efficiency and output.

Question 4: What are the three main types of volcanoes, and give one example of each type?
Answer 4: There are three main types of volcanoes: Shield Volcanoes, Stratovolcanoes (Composite Volcanoes), and Cinder Cones. Here's an example of each:

1. **Shield Volcanoes**: These volcanoes are characterized by their gently sloping shape, resembling a shield. They are typically formed by the eruption of fluid lava flows.

Example: Mauna Loa, Hawaii, USA - This volcano is one of the largest in the world and has been erupting on and off since 1984.

2. **Stratovolcanoes (Composite Volcanoes)**: These volcanoes are tall, conical, and composed of alternating layers of lava, tephra, and other pyroclastic material.

Example: Mount St. Helens, Washington, USA - This volcano erupted in 1980 in one of the most significant volcanic events in recent US history.

3. **Cinder Cones**: These volcanoes are small and steep-sided, formed by the accumulation of ash and cinder from explosive eruptions.

Example: Paricutin Volcano, Mexico - This volcano emerged from a cornfield in 1943 and grew to a height of over 425 meters (1,400 feet) before ceasing activity.
