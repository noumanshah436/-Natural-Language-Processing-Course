Why does smoothing improve perplexity on unseen text?

Smoothing adds a small probability to words or word pairs that the model never saw during training.
Without smoothing, any unseen word pair would get probability zero, which makes perplexity infinite.
By giving a small non-zero probability to unseen words, smoothing makes the model more general and helps it handle new or rare sentences better.
✅ In short: Smoothing prevents zero probabilities → improves performance on new text.

How does perplexity relate to branching probability of a language model?

Perplexity tells us how confused a language model is when predicting the next word.
It’s like asking: “On average, how many choices does the model consider possible for each word?”
A lower perplexity means the model is more confident (less confused).

Low perplexity → few likely next words → better model
High perplexity → many possible next words → weaker model

Why might Naive Bayes misclassify “not good”?

Naive Bayes treats each word independently.
It sees the word “good” (positive) and ignores the effect of “not” before it.
So it might classify “not good” as positive, even though it means negative.
✅ In short: NB doesn’t understand word order or negation — it looks only at individual words.

How can we use a held-out corpus to estimate interpolation weights between unigrams, bigrams, trigrams?

A held-out corpus is a small set of data not used in training.
We use it to test how well different combinations of unigram, bigram, and trigram probabilities perform.
By adjusting the weights (λ₁, λ₂, λ₃) for each model on this held-out data, we find the mix that gives the lowest perplexity.
✅ In short: Use extra data to tune how much trust to give to unigram, bigram, and trigram models for better predictions.
